# Intro to Error Handling

## Introduction
Welcome to Lesson 4, `Intro to Error Handling`, of The Swift Fundamentals. I feared `Error Handling`. I thought I had to be a professional debugger to fully utilize the feature. However, one day, I discovered, again. It's nothing more than writing an `else-if` block to send and deal with the error messages you've designed on your own. The built-in features of `Error Handling` since `Swift 2.0` allow you to write cleaner, modular, and readable code.

## Problem
1. How do you warn your co-workers the function may result unexpected outcomes?
2. What is a `do-try` block?
3. How do you distinguish between `try?`, `try!`, and `try`?


## Design Safety Feature
Design a safety check for riders based on height. If the passenger is taller than 2m or below 1.4m, the program will send error messages along with other instructions.

```swift
func checkHeight(height: Int) {
  if height > 200 {
    print("You are going to hit your head and fall off")
    // Take him/her off from the ride
    // Code ...
    // Seatbelt tighten

  } else if height < 140 {
    print("You might fly in the air")
    // Take him/her off from the ride
    // Code ...

  } else {
    print("Enjoy")
    // Take him/her to the ride
    // Code ...
  }
}
```

### Problem with Else-If alone
1. Bloated function
2. Lack of modularity
3. Uncertainty

## Error Handling
`Error Handling` is just additional way to write an `else-if` statement to not only deal with the error messages but also respond after them in a separate block.

### Design Error
Create an enum that conforms to the `Error` protocol. Determine a few cases.  

```swift
enum HeightError: Error {
  case maxHeight
  case minHeight
}
```

> Any type that declares conformance to the Error protocol can be used to represent an error in Swift‚Äôs error handling system. Because the Error protocol has no requirements of its own, you can declare conformance on any custom type you create.

### Design Throwable Function
Create a function that can throw/return errors by inserting `throws` at the end of the function parameter. The function does not contain error messages. Instead, it "throws" an error which will be "caught" and handled in a separate block with `do-try`.

```swift
func checkHeightError(height: Int) throws {
  if height > 200 {
    throw HeightError.maxHeight
  } else if height < 140 {
    throw HeightError.minHeight
  } else {
    print("Enjoy your ride")
  }
}
```

### Call and Handle Error
To call a function that contains `throws`, the function requires `try` within a `do` block. A `catch` block is used to recognize and the error thrown by the function. If there is no error thrown, the `catch` block is ignored.

```swift
do {
  try checkHeightError(height: 240)
} catch HeightError.maxHeight {
  print("Get out of here")
  // Logic
} catch HeightError.minHeight {
  print("Too short to ride")
}
 ```

## Error Handling with Object Initialization

### Design Error

```swift
enum NameError: Error {
  case noName
}
```

### Design Throwable Class
When the user enters an empty string when initializing, the init method throws `NameError.noName`.

```swift
class Course {
  var name: String

  init(name: String) throws {
    if name == "" {
      throw NameError.noName
    } else {
      self.name = name
      print("You've created an object!")
    }
  }
}
```

### Initialize and Handle Error
Create an object using `try` within a `do-catch` block.

```swift
do {
  let myCourse = try Course(name: "")
} catch NameError.noName {
  print("Error: please make sure enter name!")
  // Logic
}
```

## Distinguish Between `try?`, `try!`, and `try`
`try` is only used within a `do-catch` block. However, `try?` and `try!` can be used without it.

> You may get away using `try` without a `do-try` block within Playground, but it is not allowed in anywhere else.

### try?
It returns an optional type. If it throws an error, the result will be `nil`.

```swift
let newCourse = try? Course(name: "Niks the Dev") // returns Course?
let newDopeCourse = try? Course(name: "") // nil
```

### try!
It returns a normal type. If the method/init throws an error, it will crash.

```swift
let myNewCourse = try! Course(name: "Bobby Lee") // üëç
let myDopeNewCourse = try! Course(name: "") // ‚ò†Ô∏è
```

## Conclusion
You've learned the Swift Error Handling syntax such as `catch`, `do`, and `try`. To recap, you may only use `try` within a `do-catch` block to execute a throwable method. However, you may also use `try?` and `try!` alone. Again, avoid using`!` in most cases since it will break your program. If you wish to review or feel stuck, I've attached an additional article for you to study as well.

In the next lesson, you will learn the final usage of `!` and `?` in the Swift Programming Language through `type casting`which allows you to convert types that are made up of classes and possibly with structs. ü§î
