# Chapter 2

## Object Oriented Swift
Welcome to Chapter 2 of Learn Swift with NiKS. Object Oriented Programming is at the heart of the iOS ecosystem. We, developers, have no choice but to follow the platform created by Apple engineers. Therefore, one must know well about Object Oriented Programming.

The primary focus of this chapter is to understand how the platform utilizes OOP to produce modular code base. You will learn fundamentals principles such as `singleton`, type property, and `convenience` init to step your game. I've designed this chapter to be practical so that you may start using what you've learned in each lessons right in your current projects.

We will continue to focus on producing dry and quality code so that no longer feel a lack of confidence when you were asked to reveal your code. I'm here to boost your ego. Let's begin.
