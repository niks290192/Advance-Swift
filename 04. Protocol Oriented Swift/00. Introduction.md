# Chapter 4
## Protocol Oriented Swift
Welcome to Chapter 4, Protocol Oriented Swift. The primary focus of this chapter is to understand how to produce  a non-nested, value-oriented, highly scalable codebase. In Lesson 1, you will learn the syntax of Swift `protocols` and what it does at the fundamental level. In Lesson 2 and 3, you will see the problems of `type casting` and `inheritance` by comparing with the protocol way . In the last two lessons, you will learn how objects communicate with each other using the delegate and data source pattern. A lot of iOS developers do not understand the behind scene, and you will discover why the iOS ecosystem utilizes the pattern and how it works. 

> **Disclaimer:** You will not understand the statement, "Swift is a protocol oriented language" until you get to the last chapter of this course, Advanced Swift.
