# Intro to Protocol Oriented Swift
You've successfully completed Chapter 3, Protocol Oriented Swift. A protocol is like basketball coach. Classes, structs, and even enums must follow the instructions provided by the coach. In Lesson 2, you've learned how to create a scalable codebase through protocol `extension` without subclassing. In Lesson 3, you've mastered how to group objects into a single array using a protocol as the type. No more type casting. We do not want to see those big pyramids. In the last two lessons, you've studied how to pass data between classes or structs using the delegate pattern. If you wish to learn how the delegate and data source patterns works within the iOS ecosystem, I highly recommend you to wait for the next course.

However, you've only scratched the surface of Protocol Oriented Swift. In Chapter 7, you will continue to learn how to create even more reusable, cleaner, and zen code by combining protocols with generics, a.k.a, the best of the best. As I promised, you would come out coding in a different league when you join me, Bob the Developer. See you in the next chapter.
