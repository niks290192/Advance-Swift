# Chapter 5
## Swift Memory Management
Welcome to Chapter 5, Swift Memory Management. The focus is to identify pitfalls that may occur when you use reference types including classes and closures. You will learn the definition of memory within the context of the Swift Programming Language, and how it is controlled by the iOS. This chapter is designed for students like myself: No computer engineering degree and learning Swift as the first programming language. However, you must be comfortable with closures and the delegate pattern before you proceed.
