# Automatic Reference Counting

## Introduction
Welcome to Lesson 1 of Swift Memory Management. You will learn the definition of the term "memory" in the context of the Swift Programming Language. By the end, you will understand how objects are initialized and destroyed by the operating system.

## Problem
Deallocate and allocate objects with `ARC`

## What is Memory
There are primarily two places to store data: 1. RAM or 2. Hard Disk. The term "memory" refers to management of space of RAM.

When an object is initialized, it is physically stored on RAM. Since the space is limited, the object should be removed when unused. The process is known as deallocation. You will learn how to deallocate objects using `ARC`, Automatic Reference Counting.

## Design Passport
Create a class called, `Passport`. It contains two properties whose types are `Human?`and `String`. The `Human` class defined below.

```swift
class Passport {
  var human: Human?
  let citizenship: String

  init(citizenship: String) {
    self.citizenship = citizenship
    print("\(citizenship) passport generated")
  }
  deinit {
    print("I, paper, am gone")
  }
}
```

## Design Human
Create a class called, `Human`.  It contains two properties whose types are `Passport?` and `String`.

```swift
class Human {
  var passport: Passport?
  let name: String

  init(name: String) {
    self.name = name
    print("\(name) generated")
  }

  deinit {
    print("I, \(name), gone")
  }
}
```

> **Important:** The `deinit` block runs automatically when the object no longer exists on its RAM.

### Create Instances
Let us create an object without `var` or `let`.

```swift
Passport(citizenship: "Republic of Korea")
// "Republic of Korea passport generated"
// "I, paper, am gone"
```

Ironically, the `Passport` object has been deallocated immediately after initialized. Let us create a variable that has a reference to `Passport`.

```swift
var myPassport = Passport(citizenship: "The Mars")
// "The Mars passport generated"
```

The `Passport` object is not deallocated. The phenomenon is due to Automatic Reference Counting. If an object has a reference, it stays. Conversely, there is no reference, the object gets deallocated automatically.

> **The Only Rule:** If the reference count reaches zero, the object is deallocated.


### Create Instances
Create two instances one with `Human` and the other one with `Passport`.

```swift
var NiKSby: Human? = Human(name: "NiKSby")
var passport: Passport? = Passport(citizenship: "Republic of Korea")
```
Let us visualize the relationship.

### Deallocate
You may set the relationship as `nil`.  


```swift
NiKSby = nil // deallocated
passport = nil // deallocated
```

<img src="/course/memory-management/assets/12_set_relationship_nil.jpg" title="" />

> **Important:** When you set the variable as `nil`, you destroy the reference, not the object itself. The object is deallocated usually since the reference count reaches zero.



## Discover Retention Cycle
However, we do not live in an ideal world. Even if you set the reference as `nil`, the object may stay in the RAM forever.


### Create Instances
Create two instances: `NiKS` and `myPassport`.

```swift
var NiKS: Human? = Human(name: "NiKS")
var myPassport: Passport? = Passport(citizenship: "Republic of Korea")
```

Create a relationship between the instances

```swift
NiKS?.passport = myPassport
myPassport?.human = NiKS
```

Let us visualize the relationship

<img src="/course/memory-management/assets/13_create_retention_cycle.jpg" title="" />

The `Human` object has two references from `NiKS` and `Passport`. The `Passport` object has two references from `myPassport` and `Human`.

### Deallocation
Let us set the relationship from `NiKS` and `myPassport` as `nil`. However, it is not deallocated.

```swift
NiKS = nil // Human not deallocated
myPassport = nil // Passport not deallocated
```

<img src="/course/memory-management/assets/14_deallocation_failed.jpg" title="" />

The `Human` object's reference count is one from the `Passport` object. The `Passport` object's reference count is one from the `Human` object. There is no way to deallocate both of them. The current situation is called, retain cycle or memory leak.

So solve the problem, you may set one of the relationship as `weak` which does not increase the reference count.

```swift
class Passport {
  weak var human: Human?
  let citizenship: String
}
  ```

<img src="/course/memory-management/assets/15_set_one_relationship_weak.jpg" title="" />

Currently, the `Human` object has one reference count from `NiKS` only since the `weak` reference does not increase the reference count.

## Deallocation
Let us attempt to deallocate the objects.

```swift
NiKS = nil  
// "I, NiKS, gone"
```

The `Human` object is deallocated since the reference count reaches zero.

<img src="/course/memory-management/assets/16_deallocate_NiKS.jpg" title="" />


You may destroy the `Passport` object

```swift
myPassport = nil
// "I, paper, am gone"
```

<img src="/course/memory-management/assets/17_deallocate_passport.jpg" title="" />


 > **Important:** There is no such thing as retain cycle in structs and enums.

## Conclusion
First, you've learned the definition of Memory Management in the concept of the Swift Programming Language. Always think about the fridge as well as the sour milk. You only want foods that are nice and fresh. Second, when you set the variable as `nil`, it does not mean destroying the object. It means removing the reference.  Last, it's all about the reference count. Make it zero if you wish to deallocate.

In the following lesson, you will learn a possible retain cycle that might occur when you use the delegate pattern. Make sure you review the [previous lesson](/course/protocol-oriented-swift/delegate.md) before proceed.
