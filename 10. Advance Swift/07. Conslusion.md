# Conclusion
You've successfully completed the last chapter of Learn Swift with Bob. In Lesson 1, you've learned how to create nested generic structures as well as the meaning of `indirect` used in enum associated value. From Lesson 2, you may create any custom operators on your own. But, again, be careful not to over use them. After, you've mastered the entire Swift 3 Error Handling with the `rethrow` keyword. you now understand the statement, "Swift is a protocol-oriented programming language". We've looked into the four major default protocols: `Equatable`, `Comparable`, `Sequence` and `IteratorProcotol`. You've learned how native types such as `Array`, `String`, and `Int`, conforms to them and have the required methods and properties. Lastly, you've tasted what test driven development looks like and how Apple engineers use built-in assert methods to guide and help developers produce safe and stay productive.
