 1. I Like to keep it short and modularlized
 2. Prevent anything massive.

myNumber.squared //100

//: Rule in the Swift Extension
//: - You may not have stored Property


/*:
 
 Extension in Swift
 
 - Add Computed Instance properties and computed type properties.
 - Define Instance methods and Type methods (Later)
 - Provide new Initializers
 - Define Subscripts
 - Define and use new nested types with enum/struct (Later)
 - Make an existing type confirm to a protocol(Later)
